The Factory Method and Abstract Factory are both creational design patterns, but they serve different purposes.

### Factory Method Pattern:

1. Intent:
   - Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
   - Defer the instantiation of a class to its subclasses.

2. Participants:
   - Creator: Declares the factory method, which returns an object of type `Product`. It may also define a default implementation of the factory method that creates a default `Product` object.
   - ConcreteCreator: Overrides the factory method to produce objects of a specific type.
   - Product: The type of object created by the factory method.

3. Example:
   - `SimplePizzaStore` has a factory method `createPizza` that is overridden by subclasses like `NewYorkPizzaStore`, `ChicagoPizzaStore`, etc. Each subclass creates a specific type of pizza.

### Abstract Factory Pattern:

1. Intent:
   - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - The client code interacts with the factory interfaces, creating entire families of related objects.

2. Participants:
   - AbstractFactory: Declares interfaces for creating abstract product objects. It usually includes a set of factory methods, each responsible for creating a family of related products.
   - ConcreteFactory: Implements the factory interfaces, creating concrete product objects.
   - AbstractProduct: Declares interfaces for a set of distinct but related products.
   - ConcreteProduct: Implements the interfaces defined by the AbstractProduct. Each concrete product belongs to a specific product family.
   - Client: Uses only the interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct. It doesn't need to know the concrete classes.

3. Example:
   - `AbstractPizzaFactory` declares methods like `createDough`, `createSauce`, etc., each responsible for creating a specific family of related pizza ingredients. Concrete factories (`NewYorkPizzaFactory`, `ChicagoPizzaFactory`) implement these interfaces, creating ingredients specific to their style.

### Main Difference:

- The Factory Method pattern focuses on creating a single product (object) through a method that is overridden by subclasses. It's about deferring the instantiation of a single class to its subclasses.

- The Abstract Factory pattern, on the other hand, is concerned with creating families of related or dependent products. It provides interfaces for creating multiple products, and concrete factories implement these interfaces to produce products that work together.

In summary, the Factory Method is centered around creating a single product in a customizable way, while the Abstract Factory is focused on creating families of related products with their own variations.
