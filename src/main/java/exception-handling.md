### Exceptions Summary

Handling exceptions properly is crucial for building robust, maintainable, and reliable software. Below is an explanation of the summarized best practices for handling exceptions.

#### 1. When Possible, Be Explicit
Being explicit means clearly defining and handling possible exceptions in your code.

- **Clear Intentions**: Your code should make it clear when and why an exception might be thrown. This helps other developers understand the potential issues that can arise.
- **Documentation**: Document the exceptions your methods can throw using Javadoc comments. This makes it clear to the users of your code what they should expect.

```java
/**
 * Reads a file from the given path.
 *
 * @param path the file path
 * @return the content of the file
 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
 */
public String readFile(String path) throws IOException {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### 2. Use the Compiler to Enforce Error-Handling, Where Possible
Leverage checked exceptions to force callers of your methods to handle possible errors.

- **Checked Exceptions**: Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions. The compiler enforces handling these exceptions, making the code more robust.

```java
public void saveData(String data) throws IOException {
    // If an IOException occurs, the caller must handle it
    Files.write(Paths.get("output.txt"), data.getBytes());
}
```

#### 3. Proactively Avoid Corner-Cases, Where Not
Write code that avoids potential issues and handles edge cases gracefully.

- **Defensive Programming**: Validate inputs and handle edge cases early to prevent exceptions from occurring.

```java
public int divide(int numerator, int denominator) {
    if (denominator == 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Denominator cannot be zero");
    }
    return numerator / denominator;
}
```

#### 4. Unchecked Exceptions, JS/TS
In JavaScript and TypeScript, all exceptions are unchecked, meaning the compiler does not enforce handling them. This requires a proactive approach to error handling.

- **Try-Catch**: Use try-catch blocks to handle potential errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback.

```javascript
function parseJSON(jsonString) {
    try {
        return JSON.parse(jsonString);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error("Invalid JSON string", e);
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### 5. Make Exceptions Part of Your Contract
Ensure that the exceptions your code can throw are part of its public API contract, making it clear to users what errors they need to handle.

- **API Documentation**: Clearly document the exceptions your methods can throw so that users of your API know what to expect and how to handle potential errors.

```java
/**
 * Retrieves a user by their ID.
 *
 * @param userId the ID of the user
 * @return the user object
 * @throws UserNotFoundException if the user is not found
 */
public User getUserById(String userId) throws UserNotFoundException {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Summary

#### Best Practices for Exception Handling
1. **When Possible, Be Explicit**: Clearly define and document the exceptions your code might throw.
2. **Use the Compiler to Enforce Error-Handling, Where Possible**: Leverage checked exceptions to ensure callers handle errors.
3. **Proactively Avoid Corner-Cases, Where Not**: Write defensive code to handle edge cases and prevent exceptions.
4. **Unchecked Exceptions, JS/TS**: In languages with unchecked exceptions, proactively handle errors using try-catch blocks.
5. **Make Exceptions Part of Your Contract**: Ensure exceptions are documented and part of your public API contract.

By following these guidelines, you can write more robust, maintainable, and predictable code, ensuring that exceptions are handled appropriately and do not lead to unexpected failures in your applications.
